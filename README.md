3. Music NFT marketplace: Interoperability for Music NFTs
 
4. SocialFi ($MOMENT): Similar to TikTok, artists and fans can share video moments of LIVE events, recording sessions, tours, skits, covers, EPs, etcâ€¦ and every $MOMENT can be bought and sold on Loozr as digital assets.
 
5. LOOZRverse:  First-ever immersive location-based music AR/VR Metaverse. Watch the LOOZRverse demo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO5-Nx-EENc&t=23s

Loozr is the first social music streaming platform built on the blockchain where fans, artists and other music stakeholders succeed in a manner that isnâ€™t detrimental to one another.
